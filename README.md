# banana

A new Flutter application.

## Fake Backend
- Please be sure that you have Node.js installed in your machine.
- Open a terminal that points to /banana/banana_test/fake-backend
- npm install -g json-server
    - '-g' is for global installation, you can also install locally by removing -g
- Check if the installation is successful by writing the command below.
    - json-server
        - Note that you might need to start a new terminal.
    - When you run the command, you should see the manual page of json-server package.
- In the fake-backend folder, there exists 2 files, db.json and index.js respectively.
    - You can write dynamic programs to index.js which will return results as expected.
    - You can write static information to db.json and it will also return results as expected.
    - index.js uses Faker.js which is another dependency that needs to be installed.
- npm install faker.js
- Finally, start the server with respect to your choice (index.js or db.json)
    - json-server --watch index.js
    - Note that your terminal should point to /banana/banana_test/fake-backend
    - Be sure that server runs in port 3000
        - If it does not run in port 3000
            - json-server --watch --port 3000 index.js

## Traversing the app
- Check for a valid user info in order to traverse the app.
    - localhost:3000/users
- Messages are not validly generated by the fake-backend, do not rely on the responses.
